"""Structural fingerprints for SME-approved SQL snippets.

A snippet's *structural fingerprint* is the **set of base tables it touches** —
deliberately style-agnostic. Two snippets that read the same base tables are
structurally equivalent even if they rename/reorder CTEs, reorder joins, or
change windowing / bucketing logic. This is the governance gate that lets an SME
rewrite an approved snippet freely, while the Solder Engine still refuses SQL
that reaches into a different set of base tables.

The extraction is a single source of truth (SQLGlot, SQLite dialect, CTE names
excluded) so runtime validation and manifest backfill can never disagree:
``solder_engine._extract_tables_from_sql`` delegates to ``raw_base_tables`` here.

The engine NEVER generates, infers, or mutates SQL — this module only *reads*
and *compares* the SQL an SME already approved.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Join-edge fingerprint (the join dimension, added to base-table set)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The join dimension of the fingerprint is the *set of canonical join edges* a
# snippet uses. A JoinEdge is a column-qualified, alias-free, type-bearing tuple:
#
#     (table_a, column_a, table_b, column_b, join_type)
#
# Canonicalization (so one relationship == one edge regardless of authoring
# style, while optionality stays meaningful):
#   * alias-free  — equi-join columns are resolved back to their owning base
#     table via the FROM/JOIN alias map (the graph knows tables, not query
#     aliases);
#   * endpoints sorted lexicographically for a stable key;
#   * ``join_type`` is expressed RELATIVE to that sorted order — when the sort
#     swaps the two sides, LEFT<->RIGHT are flipped (INNER/FULL/CROSS are
#     symmetric, unaffected), so "A LEFT JOIN B" and the same relationship
#     written "B ... A" collapse to one canonical edge with correct optionality.
#
# Only equi-joins between two BASE tables produce a validated edge. CROSS joins,
# non-equi predicates, joins touching a CTE/subquery, and joins whose columns
# cannot be resolved to a base table are recorded as ``unresolved`` — they warn
# but never block (the base-table set already bounds which tables they reach).
#
# The engine NEVER generates joins from this — it only reads the joins an SME
# already wrote and compares them to the approved fingerprint and the graph.
