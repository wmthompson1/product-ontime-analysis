-- Ground Truth SQL: Supplier / Payables Queries
-- Perspective: Payables · Quality
-- Category: supplier_performance
-- Source: Manufacturing SQL Semantic Layer (Replit public repo)
--
-- NOTE ON FRAMING: Supplier queries ARE payables queries.
-- The Finance/AP stakeholder drives most of these intents:
--   "Which suppliers owe us credits?" = supplier_cost_penalties (Finance)
--   "Which suppliers are at risk?"    = supplier_scorecard (Quality → also Finance)
--   "What is our AP exposure?"        = supplier_payables_exposure (Finance)
--
-- When the dispatcher hears "payables", "AP", "vendor invoice", or "owe",
-- it should route to this category before considering quality-only intents.

-- Temporal binding key: :start_date  (ISO date, e.g. '2025-07-01')
-- Supplier binding key: :supplier_id (integer, optional)
