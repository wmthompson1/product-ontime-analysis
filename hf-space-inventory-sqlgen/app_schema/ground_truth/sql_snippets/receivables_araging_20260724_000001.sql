-- AR Aging Report — Open + Disputed invoices only
-- Ages each open invoice by days past due_date relative to a data-derived
-- as-of date (MAX(payment_date) from Paid invoices — the most recent
-- collection event in the system).
--
-- After collect_june2026_ar runs, all 5 pre-July-2026 invoices are Paid and
-- this query returns zero rows for that cohort, confirming the cash-to-cash
-- cycle closed correctly.
--
-- Aging buckets (days past due_date as of as_of_date):
--   Current    : due_date >= as_of_date (not yet overdue)
--   1-30 days  : 1–30 days past due
--   31-60 days : 31–60 days past due
--   >60 days   : more than 60 days past due
--
-- Optional parameter:
--   :start_date  — restrict to invoices with invoice_date >= start_date
