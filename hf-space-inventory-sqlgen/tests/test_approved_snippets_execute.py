"""Executes every APPROVED SQL snippet against the live SQLite database.

Closes the gap where a snippet can be registered as APPROVED in
reviewer_manifest.json yet fail at query time because of a schema change,
a dropped table, or a typo.  For each APPROVED entry we:

  1. Resolve its SQL file (mirroring SolderEngine's path resolution so the
     two stay in agreement on where snippets live).
  2. Read the SQL text.
  3. Run it against app_schema/manufacturing.db in read-only mode.
  4. Assert no exception is raised.

The database is opened read-only (mode=ro) so the test can never mutate
manufacturing.db, even though every approved snippet is a SELECT.

Run: python hf-space-inventory-sqlgen/tests/test_approved_snippets_execute.py
