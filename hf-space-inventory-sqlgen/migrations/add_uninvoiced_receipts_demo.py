"""Seed the Uninvoiced Receipts exception populations (three-way match).

The governed view ``payables_uninvoicedreceipts_20260706_000003`` (refactored
from the private-repo ground truth "203 3WM Uninvoiced Receipts") reports
receipt lines not fully matched to a payable. After ``complete_three_way_match``
the twin ledger is *too* clean: only one receipt line qualifies. This migration
adds three engineered exception populations, deterministically (no randomness,
dates derived from existing data) and idempotently (safe to re-run):

1. RECEIVED, NEVER INVOICED — PO-000002 and PO-000006 (previously receipt-less
   and invoice-less) get a full receipt of their FIRST line, no payable at all.
   These join PO-000009 in the "goods in, no invoice on file" population.
2. UNDER-INVOICED — PO-000007's first line is received in full but its new
   payable (INV-UNINV-01, Open / Pending) bills only 60% of the received
   quantity, so payable coverage < received quantity.
3. CANCELLED VOUCHER — PO-000013's first line is received in full and fully
   billed, but the voucher (INV-UNINV-02) is status 'Cancelled'; the exception
   logic excludes cancelled vouchers from coverage (the twin analog of the
   real query's PAY_STATUS <> 'L' / 'X'), so the line stays uninvoiced.

Rules respected:
  - No new PO headers (demo-scale bands untouched); receipts hang off existing
    open POs that carry no receipts and no invoices today.
  - MRP-critical POs (PO-MRP-*, PO-CON-001) never touched; no
    purchase_order.status changes; no inventory-ledger writes (receipts here
    are AP evidence, not stock) — same scope rules as complete_three_way_match.
  - Receipt dates are derived from MAX(receiving.receipt_date) with fixed
    per-population offsets; invoice dates follow receipt dates.
  - FAIL-CLOSED VERIFY at the end: each engineered population must appear in
    the governed view's result set, else exit non-zero.
