"""Complete the three-way match chain: PO <-> receiver <-> payable.

Before this migration only 3 of 24 POs had receipts while 11 carried
invoices, so most invoices had no receiver leg and only 6 of 29 payable
lines linked to a receipt line. This migration completes the chain
deterministically (no randomness, all dates derived from existing data)
and idempotently (safe to re-run):

1. RECEIPT BACKFILL — every Closed PO with an invoice gets a full receipt
   (one denormalized ``receiving`` header row per PO line + one
   ``receiving_line`` linked to that PO line, quantity received = ordered,
   inspection Passed). Receipt dates = invoice_date - 5 days, so the
   receiver leg always precedes the invoice.
2. ENGINEERED POPULATIONS —
   - PO-000001 (Disputed / Exception): highest-value line received SHORT
     (80% of ordered) while the invoice bills the full quantity — a real
     quantity-mismatch exception.
   - PO-000010 (voucher pending): first two lines received, third line not
     yet arrived; invoice bills all three, so the voucher cannot clear —
     its match status is repaired Matched -> Pending.
   - PO-000009 (received, not invoiced): first line received, no payable
     row at all — the receiving-side voucher-pending population.
   - PO-000014 (Paid / Matched, was receipt-less): received in full so the
     paid-and-matched invoice is actually consistent.
3. STATUS REPAIR — invoices 'INV-000003' / 'INV-000008' were Paid but
   still Pending; both POs are Closed and now fully received, so they
   become Matched. 'INV-000004' becomes Pending (see PO-000010 above).
4. LINK REPAIR — every payable line whose PO line now has a receipt line
   gets its ``receipt_line_id`` populated (by po_line_id, never by fuzzy
   part match). Lines for unreceived PO lines stay NULL by design.
5. FAIL-CLOSED VERIFY — the migration re-checks every invariant at the end
   and exits non-zero on any drift.

Out of scope, on purpose:
  - MRP-critical POs (PO-MRP-BLK1..3, PO-MRP-P-10032, PO-CON-001) are
    never touched.
  - No purchase_order.status changes (MRP reads open/partial PO lines).
  - No inventory-ledger writes (receipts here are AP evidence, not stock).
