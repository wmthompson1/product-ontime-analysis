"""Collect June 2026 AR — three weekly installments (July 7, July 14, July 21).

Business story: all five open June 2026 accounts-receivable invoices are
collected across three equal weekly installments in July 2026. This completes
the cash-to-cash cycle for the June close and makes the AR aging story
credible through July 2026.

Five invoices open as of 2026-06-30 (total $60,823.54):
  AR-CO-00007  $1,051.98   Open
  AR-CO-00004  $4,629.32   Open
  AR-CO-00006  $403.84     Open
  AR-CO-00013  $816.05     Open
  AR-CO-00009  $53,922.35  Disputed (Gulfstream Aerospace)

What this migration does (deterministic, idempotent, fail-closed):

1. DDL — creates receivable_payment with a UNIQUE(invoice_id, installment_no)
   constraint (idempotency key). Also registered in schema_nodes +
   schema_edges (edges 44-45).

2. INSTALLMENTS — for each of the 5 open June invoices, splits the amount
   into three installments (integer-cent thirds; final tranche carries the
   cent-exact remainder). Payment dates: 2026-07-07, 2026-07-14, 2026-07-21.
   Inserts via INSERT OR IGNORE (safe to re-run).

3. GL POSTING — calls post_cash_receipt for each installment row, keyed by
   (source_table='receivable_payment', source_id=payment_id). Idempotent via
   the (source_table, source_id, event_type) key in gl_events.

4. STATUS UPDATE — marks all five invoices status='Paid',
   payment_date='2026-07-21', guarded by: all 3 installments present AND
   SUM(installments) == amount_dollars ± 0.01. Only transitions Open/Disputed
   -> Paid; already-Paid invoices are skipped.

5. FAIL-CLOSED VERIFY — checks:
   - receivable_payment row count == 15 (5 invoices × 3 installments)
   - SUM(installments) == amount_dollars per invoice (±$0.01)
   - all 5 June invoices are now Paid with payment_date='2026-07-21'
   - gl_events gained exactly 15 CASH_RECEIPT rows
   - all CASH_RECEIPT amounts are positive

Out of scope (deliberate):
  - New AR invoices for the CO-MRP-002 July 23 shipment (July AR, not June AR).
  - GL control accounts / cash balance accounts (none by design).
  - Revenue recognition entries (shipment already relieves FG cost).
  - Changes to MRP or demand logic.
