"""Seed the Partial-Receipt Accrual Exposure populations (PO-line accrual).

The governed view ``payables_partialreceiptaccrual_20260708_000004`` (grounded
in the TWM accrual guides, docs/my-mrp-kb/07-three-way-match/) reports PO lines
in the partial-receipt accrual condition:

    receivedQty > 0 AND receivedQty < orderedQty AND invoicedQty < receivedQty

i.e. open Purchase Receipt Accrual (PRA) exposure on partially received lines.
After ``complete_three_way_match`` + ``add_uninvoiced_receipts_demo`` the twin
ledger has partial receipts, but every one of them is fully voucher-covered,
so the view is empty. This migration adds two engineered populations,
deterministically (no randomness, dates derived from existing data) and
idempotently (safe to re-run):

1. PARTIAL RECEIPT, NEVER INVOICED — PO-000009 gets ONE new engineered line
   (qty 20) received at 60% (12), with no payable at all. The full received
   quantity is open PRA.
2. PARTIAL RECEIPT, UNDER-INVOICED — PO-000010 gets ONE new engineered line
   (qty 20) received at 70% (14); its voucher (INV-PRA-01, Open / Pending)
   bills only half the received quantity (7), so voucher coverage < received.

Rules respected:
  - No new PO headers (demo-scale bands scale via PO LINES, never headers);
    engineered lines hang off existing non-cancelled material POs.
  - MRP-critical POs (PO-MRP-*, PO-CON-001) never touched; no
    purchase_order.status changes; no inventory-ledger writes (receipts here
    are AP evidence, not stock) — same scope rules as the sibling demos.
  - The engineered part on each line is chosen DETERMINISTICALLY from the
    supplier's own catalog: the alphabetically-first part this supplier
    already supplies on other po_lines that is not already on the target PO
    (grounded in the real supplier relationship, never invented).
  - purchase_order.total_cost is incremented by the new line_total so the
    header stays consistent with SUM(po_line.line_total).
  - Receipt dates are derived from MAX(receiving.receipt_date) with fixed
    per-population offsets; invoice dates follow receipt dates.
  - FAIL-CLOSED VERIFY at the end: each engineered population must appear in
    the governed view's result set with the exact quantity shape, else exit
    non-zero.
