### Key Benefits for Business Use

**Professional Infrastructure**
- 99.95% uptime guarantee for critical business applications
- Automatic SSL certificates and HTTPS security
- Global CDN distribution for fast access worldwide
- Enterprise-grade monitoring and analytics

### Recommended Deployment Type for Your Analysis Tool

**Autoscale Deployment** is ideal for your Product On-Time Analysis application because:
- **Variable Usage**: Manufacturing teams access it when analyzing daily/weekly data
- **Cost Efficiency**: Only pay when team members are running analyses
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handles multiple users during peak analysis periods
- **Web-Based**: Perfect for Flask applications with HTML interfaces

### Estimated Monthly Costs for Business Use

**Small Team (10-20 users, 5,000 analyses/month)**
- Base fee: $1.00/month
- Compute usage: ~$2.50/month
- Requests: ~$0.60/month
- **Total: ~$4.10/month**

**Medium Team (50-100 users, 25,000 analyses/month)**  
- Base fee: $1.00/month
- Compute usage: ~$8.00/month
- Requests: ~$3.00/month
- **Total: ~$12.00/month**

*Note: Teams plan includes $40/month in credits per user, so small to medium usage is often covered by existing subscription credits.*
