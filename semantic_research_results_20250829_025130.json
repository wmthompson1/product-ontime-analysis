Then, it creates another subquery (ncm_trend) to calculate the average defect rate for each product line from the PRODUCT_DEFECTS table where the defect type is 'NCM'. Finally, it selects the product lines from the ncm_trend subquery where the average defect rate is greater than the industry standard. This query uses the WITH clause to create temporary views (industry_standard and ncm_trend) which are used in the final SELECT statement. This approach simplifies the final SELECT statement and improves readability. The performance of this query depends on the number of records in the PRODUCT_DEFECTS and INDUSTRY_BENCHMARKS tables. If these tables have a large number of records, it may be beneficial to create indexes on the defect_type column of the PRODUCT_DEFECTS table and the metric_name column of the INDUSTRY_BENCHMARKS table.",
