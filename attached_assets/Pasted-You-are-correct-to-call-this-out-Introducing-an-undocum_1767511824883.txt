You are correct to call this out. Introducing an undocumented weight of **3** materially changes the semantics of the model and undermines one of its core strengths: **explainable, path-based reasoning**. I will address this in four parts:

1. **Correcting the weight model (binary, not scalar)**
2. **Formalizing path-based reasoning with your clarified semantics**
3. **Valid traversal patterns enabled by your design**
4. **What must be constrained or forbidden to keep the model coherent**

---

## 1. Weight Semantics: Enforce Binary or Ternary, Not Ordinal

### Your stated rule (correct):

Intent elevation is **not prioritization**; it is **activation**.

Therefore, intent-to-concept and intent-to-perspective weights should mean:

| Value | Meaning                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| `1`   | Explicitly elevated / active |
| `0`   | Neutral / not selected       |
| `-1`  | Explicitly suppressed        |

Anything else (e.g., `3`) is **invalid state**.

---

### Why Scalar Weights Break the Model

Allowing `3`, `5`, etc. implies:

* Ranking between meanings (not allowed)
* Probabilistic inference (not present)
* Optimization semantics (not desired)

Your system is **logical**, not **numeric**.

> A path exists or it does not.
> It is allowed or disallowed.
> That is the reasoning unit.

---

### Recommendation (Concrete)

Add **CHECK constraints** immediately:

```sql
ALTER TABLE schema_intent_concepts
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_intent_factor_weight
CHECK (intent_factor_weight IN (-1, 0, 1));

ALTER TABLE schema_intent_perspectives
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_intent_perspective_weight
CHECK (intent_factor_weight IN (-1, 0, 1));
```

This prevents semantic drift by tooling or agents.

---

## 2. Path-Based Reasoning: Now Precisely Defined

With binary / ternary intent control, path reasoning becomes deterministic.

### Canonical Disambiguation Path

```
(Field)
  -[:CAN_MEAN]->
(Concept)
  <-[:USES_DEFINITION]-
(Perspective)
  <-[:OPERATES_WITHIN]-
(Intent)
```

**Validity rules:**

1. Path must exist
2. No edge on the path may have weight = -1
3. At least one edge must be active (1) or default (0)

This yields **exactly one interpretation per field per intent per perspective**.

---

## 3. Traversal Patterns Your Model Now Supports

You correctly enumerated three—here they are formalized.

---

### A. Disambiguation

**Problem:** `status` appears everywhere.

**Traversal:**

```
Field(status)
 → Concept(c)
 ← Perspective(p)
 ← Intent(i)
```

**Constraint:**

* `i → p` weight ≠ -1
* `p → c` relationship ≠ SUPPRESSED

**Result:**

* Meaning resolved without rewriting SQL
* Explanation is the traversal itself

---

### B. Concept Rollup (Hierarchical Aggregation)

This is enabled by:

```sql
schema_concepts.parent_concept_id
```

Graphically:

```
ChildConcept
  -[:REFINES]->
ParentConcept
```

**Use cases:**

* Roll multiple failure modes into “Equipment Reliability”
* Aggregate quality defects under “Production Quality”

**Important rule:**

> Rollup is allowed **only upward**
> Never infer downward

Traversal:

```
(:Concept {failure_mode})
  -[:REFINES*]->
(:Concept {Reliability})
```

This enables:

* Metric aggregation
* Cross-table analytics
* KPI normalization

---

### C. Cross-Perspective Queries (Your Most Powerful Feature)

Same field. Same value. Different meaning.

Example:

```
production_lines.status = 'Active'
```

| Perspective | Concept                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Operations  | OperationalAvailability  |
| Finance     | AssetCapitalizationState |
| Compliance  | CertificationStatus      |

Traversal differs only at the `Perspective` node.

This allows:

* Parallel interpretations
* Stakeholder-specific dashboards
* No schema branching
* No duplicated SQL

---

## 4. What Must Be Explicitly Forbidden

To preserve semantic integrity, the following must **never** occur:

### ❌ Numeric weighting beyond {-1,0,1}

Breaks logical reasoning.

### ❌ Intent bypassing Perspective

Destroys organizational scoping.

### ❌ Concept-to-Concept lateral inference

Only parent-child (`REFINES`) allowed.

### ❌ Multiple active Concepts for same Field + Perspective + Intent

Ambiguity must be resolved, not multiplied.

Enforce with a uniqueness rule at resolution time:

```
(Field, Perspective, Intent) → exactly one active Concept
```

---

## 5. Why Your Model Is Now Formally Sound

With these clarifications:

* The graph is **explainable**
* Traversals are **deterministic**
* SQL remains **unchanged**
* Ambiguity is **managed, not eliminated**
* Agents cannot silently mutate meaning

This is the key distinction between:

> *semantic modeling*
> vs
> *heuristic enrichment*

You are firmly in the former.

---

### If you want next steps:

* Formal resolution algorithm (step-by-step)
* SQL rewrite examples driven by graph traversal
* Detecting semantic conflicts automatically
* Converting this to native graph DB constraints

Your correction was not cosmetic—it was foundational.
