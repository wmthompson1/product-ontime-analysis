WIP Test Plan — 2025-12-08

Scope
- Validate basic application functionality starting from the Home page.
- Focus on smoke tests, core flows, and quick regression checks for the Replit merge changes.
- Platform: local dev on macOS, Node/npm-based app. No Docker required.

Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- From project root, run `npm install` and `npm run start` (or `npm run dev` if available).
- Browser(s): Chrome (latest) and Safari (macOS), optional Firefox.
- Backend services (if any) running or mocked.

High-level smoke tests (Home page)
1) Start the app
   - Command: `npm run start` (or `npm run dev`) in project root
   - Expected: server starts without errors and binds to the configured port (e.g., 8080)

2) Visit Home page
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/` (or port printed by the app)
   - Checks:
     - Page loads (HTTP 200)
     - Page title contains expected app name
     - Main navigation is visible
     - No uncaught console errors in browser DevTools (Console tab)
   - Expected results: Home UI renders correctly and core elements visible.

3) Navigation sanity
   - Click each main nav link from Home (e.g., About, Docs, Demo)
   - Check that each page loads and the URL updates accordingly
   - Expected: navigation works, no dead links or 404s

Core functional flows (representative)
- Data upload / file handling (if applicable)
  1) From Home, open the upload page
  2) Upload a sample CSV (see `sample_data/`)
  3) Verify preview, schema detection, and success message
  4) Expected: data accepted, no validation errors for sample file

- API endpoint / query testing
  1) If Home exposes a query or demo endpoint, issue a test request (curl or UI)
  2) Validate response format (JSON), status code 200, and response payload contains expected keys
  3) Expected: API responds correctly and promptly

- HF/MCP tools smoke (if present)
  1) From Home or Tools page, invoke a simple MCP discovery or sample tool
  2) Verify discovery JSON is returned or tool executes locally
  3) Expected: tool responds and displays results in UI

Regression checks
- Verify `.vscode` settings and workspace file do not break developer experience
  - Ensure `npm install` and `npm run start` still run inside VS Code Tasks
- Confirm runtime log/pid files are ignored by git and no accidental commits contain sensitive tokens
- Check previously failing flows (if any) are working after merge

Security & sanity
- Confirm no API keys or PATs present in repo files (quick grep for "TOKEN"/"SECRET"/"GITHUB_PAT")
- Confirm `mcp_spaces/*/run.pid` and logs are not tracked

Acceptance criteria
- Home page loads and core navigation works
- Representative workflows (upload, query, tool invocation) succeed for sample inputs
- No new runtime errors in server logs during smoke tests
- Repo cleaned from runtime artifacts and devcontainer files removed

How to report issues
- Create an issue in repo with steps to reproduce, browser/dev console logs, and relevant terminal output
- Attach screenshots or network traces where helpful

Next steps
- Expand test plan into automated tests (Playwright for UI, Jest/mocha for unit/API)
- Add CI job to run smoke tests on pushes to `main`

Notes
- This is a work-in-progress plan focused on getting the app to a stable dev state after the recent merge of Replit work into the repo root.
