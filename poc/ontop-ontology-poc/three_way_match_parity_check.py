Three-way-match parity check: virtual SPARQL graph (Ontop) vs governed SQL.
================================================================================

The TENTH governed showcase. Proves that the procure-to-pay three-way match
(PO line <-> receipt line <-> invoice line) answered through the standards-based
virtual knowledge graph (Ontop rewriting SPARQL -> SQL over manufacturing.db)
matches, to floating-point tolerance, the numbers direct governed SQL produces
over the SAME read-only snapshot.

Grounding. The match is governed by THREE SME-approved views in the Ground
Truth SQL layer (perspective Payables, category delivery_performance):

  * payables_ordersreceived_20260706_000001      — POs fully received (legs 1-2)
  * payables_ordersunreceived_20260706_000002    — POs unreceived / short
  * payables_uninvoicedreceipts_20260706_000003  — receipt lines not fully
    covered by non-cancelled payable lines (the receipt <-> invoice leg 3,
    refactored from the private-repo "203 3WM Uninvoiced Receipts")

plus the SME doc set in docs/my-mrp-kb/07-three-way-match/ ("Uninvoiced
Receivers Report - Detailed"). The scalar per-leg aggregates checked here are
restated directly from those governed surfaces' base tables (po_line /
receiving_line / payable_line), and the governed views themselves are executed
on the same snapshot as cross-checks: the received/unreceived PO sets must
stay disjoint (the invariant the ground-truth gate
tests/test_procurement_views.py locks in), and the uninvoiced-receipts view
must report exactly the receipt set an independent grouped-LEFT-JOIN
restatement finds.

Invoiced-link semantics (aligned end-to-end, SPARQL <-> SQL):

  * The :invoicesReceipt LINK is defined by the receipt pointer ALONE — a
    payable line with receipt_line_id populated invoices that receipt, whether
    or not its qty column is populated. The SQL side states the same thing
    (COUNT ... WHERE receipt_line_id IS NOT NULL / LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL).
  * :invoicedQty is published only where BOTH receipt_line_id AND qty are
    non-null — a (possibly) smaller population, checked separately by row
    count AND sum against the identically-filtered SQL.

The headline "Uninvoiced Receivers" number (receipt lines nobody has billed
yet) is NOT expressed as SPARQL negation — FILTER NOT EXISTS is outside the
Ontop+SQLite shapes this POC keeps to (no GROUP BY / no OPTIONAL / no CASE
inside SUM). Instead, two scalar queries are subtracted here in Python:

    uninvoiced receivers = COUNT(all receipt lines)
                         - COUNT(payable lines linked to a receipt line)

exactly like the inventory showcase nets In/Out movement in Python. A built-in
SEMANTICS REGRESSION (in-memory fixture DB, runs before anything else) locks in
the qty-null edge case: a payable line with receipt_line_id NOT NULL and qty
NULL still counts as an invoiced link (so its receipt is NOT an uninvoiced
receiver) while contributing nothing to the invoiced-qty population.

Read-only by design (same guarantees as parity_check.py): the live WAL-mode DB
is opened only to take a backup snapshot; Ontop and the governed SQL both read
the same snapshot, so the two engines provably see identical data; nothing ever
writes the live file and ArangoDB is never touched.

Not wired into scripts/post-merge.sh (it needs the Java + Ontop toolchain, like
parity_check.py). Run it directly:

    python3 poc/ontop-ontology-poc/three_way_match_parity_check.py

Exit code 0 on parity, 1 on mismatch or error.
