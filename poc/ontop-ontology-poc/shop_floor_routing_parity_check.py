Shop-floor routing parity check: virtual SPARQL graph (Ontop) vs governed SQL.
================================================================================

The EIGHTH governed showcase. Proves that the shop-floor work & routing layer
answered through the standards-based virtual knowledge graph (Ontop rewriting
SPARQL -> SQL over manufacturing.db) matches, to floating-point tolerance, the
numbers the governed SQLite grounding query produces over the SAME read-only
snapshot.

LIKE SHOWCASES 6 (customer-order demand) AND 7 (capacity planning), AND UNLIKE
the on-time / OEE showcases, the routing layer has NO computation_template /
concept — it was delivered as SME-approved docs + a runnable SQLite grounding
query only (archived at hf-space-inventory-sqlgen/app_schema/ground_truth/sql_snippets/
_archived/manufacturing_shopfloorrouting_20260704_000003.sql). So this check grounds
the SPARQL answers against that DIRECT governed SQL, run on the same snapshot.
The SQL stays the single source of truth; Ontop is only a publishing layer over
it.

The grounding is a STRICT TWO-TABLE join of work_order and operation on wo_id; no
third table is added (the work-station name lives in prose only, matching the
grounding SQL).

Two headline routing questions, both restated from the grounding query:
  * total routing-step run hours across work orders = SUM(run_hrs) over every
    routing operation (the horizon-total run hours).
  * routing-step count for ONE specific work order = COUNT(operations) for
    WO-240003, the closed AIRFRAME traveler the grounding doc walks step by step.

Both SPARQL queries are scalar (no GROUP BY / no OPTIONAL), so they stay within
the Ontop+SQLite shapes that serialize cleanly.

Read-only by design (same guarantees as parity_check.py): the live WAL-mode DB is
opened only to take a backup snapshot; Ontop and the governed SQL both read the
same snapshot, so the two engines provably see identical data; nothing ever writes
the live file and ArangoDB is never touched.

Not wired into scripts/post-merge.sh (it needs the Java + Ontop toolchain, like
parity_check.py). Run it directly:

    python3 poc/ontop-ontology-poc/shop_floor_routing_parity_check.py

Exit code 0 on parity, 1 on mismatch or error.
