"""
Full supplier-rating parity proof + SQLGlot lift of the SQLite OPTIONAL/GROUP BY limit.
=======================================================================================

Proves two things at once, read-only, against a throwaway snapshot of the live
manufacturing database.

  1. THE FULL "MY MRP" SUPPLIER RATING, RECOMPUTED THROUGH THE VIRTUAL GRAPH.
     The deterministic supplier performance rating
         rating = clamp(5 * (0.55*OTD + 0.45*quality), 1, 5), rounded to 2dp
     (quality = (Passed+Waived)/(Passed+Waived+Failed), neutral 0.75 when there
     are no graded receipts; a supplier with no receipts at all = neutral 3.0) is
     reassembled ENTIRELY from triples Ontop publishes over the SQL layer:
         AVG(:opsOnTimeScore) per supplier  -> OTD
         AVG(:qualityScore)   per supplier  -> quality
         COUNT(:hasDelivery)  per supplier  -> receipt count
     and the result is compared, per supplier, to the migration's stored
     suppliers.performance_rating. Exit non-zero on any mismatch.

  2. THE SQLite OPTIONAL + GROUP BY LIMIT IS LIFTED.
     The OTD and quality queries are multi-triple OPTIONALs combined with
     GROUP BY + AVG. Ontop serializes those as a nested LEFT JOIN whose SQL uses
     stacked ON clauses (A LEFT JOIN B JOIN C ON inner ON outer) that the SQLite
     parser rejects ("near ON"). This check captures Ontop's generated SQL from
     its DEBUG log, proves SQLite rejects it raw, then re-transpiles it with
     SQLGlot (sql_lift.lift_join_groups parenthesizes the nested join group) and
     runs the lifted SQL successfully on the same snapshot.

Read-only by design (same guarantees as parity_check.py): the live WAL-mode DB is
opened only to take a backup snapshot; Ontop and this checker both read the
snapshot; nothing ever writes the live file and ArangoDB is never touched.

Not wired into scripts/post-merge.sh (it needs the Java + Ontop toolchain, like
parity_check.py). Run it directly:

    python3 poc/ontop-ontology-poc/rating_parity_check.py

Exit code 0 on full parity + a demonstrated lift, 1 on mismatch / lift failure / error.
