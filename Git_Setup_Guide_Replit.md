```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/product-ontime-analysis.git
```

**Step 3: Make Initial Commit**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Product On-Time Analysis Tool

- Complete Flask application with statistical analysis
- CSV upload functionality for delivery data

## Git Workflow for Your Analysis Tool

### Daily Development Workflow

**1. Before Making Changes:**
```bash
git status                    # Check current state
git pull origin main         # Get latest changes
```

**2. After Adding Features:**
```bash
git add .                    # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Add feature: [describe what you added]"
git push origin main         # Upload to GitHub
```

### Example Commit Messages for Your Project:
```bash
git commit -m "Add Wilson score intervals for edge cases"
git commit -m "Improve CSV upload error handling"
git commit -m "Add export functionality for analysis results"
git commit -m "Update statistical reporting format"
```

### Branching Strategy for New Features

**Testing New Statistical Methods:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/advanced-statistics
# Make your changes and test
git add .
git commit -m "Add seasonal adjustment analysis"
git push origin feature/advanced-statistics
```

**Merge when ready:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/advanced-statistics
git push origin main
```

git remote set-url origin https://yourusername:personal_access_token@github.com/yourusername/product-ontime-analysis.git
```

### Large File Issues
```bash
# If CSV files are too large
git rm --cached large_file.csv
echo "*.csv" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Exclude large CSV files from repository"
```

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# When conflicts occur
git status                   # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```
