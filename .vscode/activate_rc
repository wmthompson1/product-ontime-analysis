#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This RC file is used by the integrated terminal profile `bash-venv`.
# It sources the repository venv (if present) and then sources the user's bashrc.

# NOTE: The original file automatically sourced the workspace venv which can
# cause the environment to be activated during terminal startup and may
# unintentionally execute code when the file is sourced. To avoid accidental
# sourcing of venv activation, the automatic source is commented out here.
# If you want automatic activation, uncomment the block below.
#
# # Source the workspace venv if it exists
# if [ -f "${PWD}/.venv/bin/activate" ]; then
#   # shellcheck disable=SC1090
#   . "${PWD}/.venv/bin/activate"
# fi

# Source user's ~/.bashrc so normal interactive settings still apply
if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
  # shellcheck disable=SC1090
  . "$HOME/.bashrc"
fi

# Make prompt obvious
PS1="(venv) $PS1"
