This is done only for defects of type 'NCM'. Then, from this CTE, it selects the product lines where the moving average defect rate is greater than the industry standard of 2.5% (0.025). The results are ordered in descending order of the defect rate. The window function AVG() OVER (PARTITION BY pd.product_line ORDER BY pd.production_date ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) calculates the moving average defect rate for each product line. The PARTITION BY clause divides the result set into partitions (groups) by product line. The ORDER BY clause orders the rows in each partition by production date. The ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW clause defines the window frame, i.e., the set of rows used in calculation for the current row. Here, it includes the current row and the three preceding rows.
