*Figure 1 (below): A complex example of Text-to-SQL from Bird. We demonstrate two common types of errors happened in LLM-based parsing: SQL with syntax errors, where missing table names are easily detected, while SQL with semantic errors is often executed, leading to user confusion.*

*Figure 2 (below): The overview of SQLFixAgent framework, which comprises three agents: (i) the SQLReviewer, which detects syntax and semantic errors in SQL generated by SQLTool based on user query and schema sequence, (ii) the QueryCrafter, which generates multiple variants of user query, then utilizes SQLTool to generate multiple SQL as candidate repairs, and (iii) the SQLRefiner, which records runtime errors from SQLTool, and selects the optimal SQL as the final repair from candidates.*
